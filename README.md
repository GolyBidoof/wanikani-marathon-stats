# WaniKani Reading Marathon Stats

A statistics explorer for the WaniKani community's 24-hour reading marathons, hosted by **Taiyousea** on the WaniKani forums.

## What is the 24-hour Readathon?

The **24-hour Readathon** is a community event where participants attempt to read as much Japanese as they can within a 24-hour period. Participants track pages, characters, or time spent reading, then report their final numbers to the community. These stats are tallied together to celebrate what we can accomplish as a group!

Whether you're finishing a book club pick or just squeezing in a few pages, every contribution boosts the collective totals.
